Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study

This repository contains analysis for the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study for my Google Data Analytics Capstone Project. In this course, I was given data to analyze for a fictional company, Cyclistic, to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. I would take these insights and provide recommendations to the Cyclistic executives in order to create a marketing campaign that would attract casual riders to convert into annual members.
